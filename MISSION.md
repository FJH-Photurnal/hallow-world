# A mission statement for personal inspiration and incentive.

This project seeks to build and document a focused development environment useful for dilletant and casual users alike. Premissed on a complete workflow using low-powered platforms targeted at MCU development. Incidentally offering a low-cost development system.

Using the latest Raspberry Pi model 4 as the coding platform, no-cost IDE systems and open-source resources reduces out-of-pocket cost to that of the Pi 4 along with the effort needed to configure the system. 

The initial objective is to build and document a personally effective development environment using a Pi4. Create a readilly duplicted system configuration with shared authentications to work on different PI's. 

The next objective is to generalise these authentications for wider application.
