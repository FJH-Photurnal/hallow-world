# hallow-world
My local experimental and learning repository.

Beginning again with an MCU (RP2040 Pico and Feather) fixation. Reviving some old concepts and developing new. Also, considering a global and social context in light of the recent Covid-19 pandemic. 

As with everything I do, I need to understand it all before I commit to any action. Typically remaining in the virtual spaces within my brain but occasionally escaping into the real world as evidenced by this activity.

This is the next first step for me, building a focused development environment, using Git, Visual Studio Code and the internet to code for low-powered SBC's and MCU's. While the initial few weeks were compromised by my attempt to install and try everything (on an ARM platform) at once the realisation that I need an x86 platform has arrived. Thus, my resurection of a laptop and the system I am now using, an ancient celeron that has been on 24/7 for some 4 years or more.
